Contain three elements in the dataset: Impactive features (X), Time Column, Event Column

STEP 1: Identify the appropriate time column
In practical projects, information is collected in several time grids. Based on the goal of the analysis, select the accumulated member existing time as the time column
Because the subscriptions of the products are renewed every year, also skim the data points which represent the new customers (who do not have an opportunity to decide to churn)

# Plot the general distribution of time column, eyeballing the existing length of customers
plt.hist(df_skimed['Cum_MM_Active'],bins=?)


STEP 2: Apply the Kaplan-Meier Estimator to plot the survival function, get a general idea about the survival probabilities with time changing
# For each point on the curve, we could describe the data like: 
# y is the probability that the time between a objective start this experiement to the end of this experiment (the event occure) is greater than x months.
from lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter
durations = df_skimed[Time]
event_observed = df_skimed[Event]

kmf = KaplanMeierFitter() 
# Fit the data into the model
kmf.fit(durations, event_observed,label='Kaplan Meier Estimate')
# Create an estimate
kmf.plot(ci_show=False)                                  #ci_show is if the confidence interval showed on the plot
# Also calculate the estimated median time to event occure
kmf.median_survival_time_


STEP 3: Fit in several parameter model fast and auto pick the best model 
# Just for general idea before further analyzing
# Plot QQ plot for virsualized model performance

from lifelines.plotting import qq_plot
# AIC comparisons between univariate parametric models
from lifelines.utils import find_best_parametric_model
from lifelines import (WeibullFitter, ExponentialFitter, LogNormalFitter, LogLogisticFitter, 
                       NelsonAalenFitter, GeneralizedGammaFitter)

fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 2, figsize=(12, 8))

durations = df_skimed[Time]
event_observed = df_skimed[Event]

kmf = KaplanMeierFitter().fit(durations, event_observed, label='KaplanMeierFitter')
wbf = WeibullFitter().fit(durations, event_observed, label='WeibullFitter')
exf = ExponentialFitter().fit(durations, event_observed, label='ExponentialFitter')
lnf = LogNormalFitter().fit(durations, event_observed, label='LogNormalFitter')
llf = LogLogisticFitter().fit(durations, event_observed, label='LogLogisticFitter')
gg = GeneralizedGammaFitter().fit(durations, event_observed, label='GeneralizedGammaFitter')

kmf.plot_survival_function(ax=axes[0][0])
wbf.plot_survival_function(ax=axes[1][1])
exf.plot_survival_function(ax=axes[0][1])
lnf.plot_survival_function(ax=axes[1][0])
llf.plot_survival_function(ax=axes[2][0])
gg.plot_survival_function(ax=axes[2][1])

# Plot QQ plot for evaluating performance 
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(10, 8))
axes = axes.reshape(4,)

for i, model in enumerate([WeibullFitter(), LogNormalFitter(), LogLogisticFitter(), ExponentialFitter()]):
    model.fit(durations, event_observed)
    qq_plot(model, ax=axes[i])

# Select the best model with lower AIC
best_model, best_aic_ = find_best_parametric_model(durations, event_observed, scoring_method="AIC")
# Best parametric models
best_model.plot_survival_function()

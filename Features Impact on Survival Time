With the KaplanMeierFitter in the lifelines package, we could detect the impact of categorical feature on the objects life time.
Because the number of features will affect on the model's running time and performance, we could condier to kick the tiny impactive features out brfore modeling

The main idea is comparing the survival function curve in different group of data points
The whole data set is splitted based on one feature

STEP 1: Transform numerical features to categorical features (according to distribution or practical understanding)

STEP 2: Plot the survival function curves and detect the significantation of differences in curves looks similar
from lifelines.statistics import logrank_test
from lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter

# Plot Survival Function Curve
kmf_[feature] = KaplanMeierFitter() 

groups = fine_cat_df[[featur]]        # The feature must be categorical          
ix1 = (groups == ct1)  
ix2 = (groups == ct2)        
ix3 = (groups == ct3)   
ix4 = (groups == ct4) 
ix5 = (groups == ct5) 
ix6 = (groups == ct6) 
ix7 = (groups == ct7)

kmf_[feature].fit(T[ix1], E[ix1], label=ct1)    
ax = kmf_[feature].plot()
kmf_[feature].fit(T[ix2], E[ix2], label=ct2)   
ax1 = kmf_[feature].plot(ax=ax)
kmf_[feature].fit(T[ix3], E[ix3], label=ct3) 
ax2 = kmf_[feature].plot(ax=ax1)
kmf_[feature].fit(T[ix4], E[ix4], label=ct4)
ax3 = kmf_[feature].plot(ax=ax2)
kmf_[feature].fit(T[ix5], E[ix5], label=ct5)
ax4 = kmf_[feature].plot(ax=ax3)
kmf_[feature].fit(T[ix6], E[ix6], label=ct6)
ax5 = kmf_[feature].plot(ax=ax4)
kmf_[feature].fit(T[ix7], E[ix7], label=ct7)
kmf_[feature].plot(ax=ax5)                

# Define logrank test
output = logrank_test(
durations_A = fine_cat_df[ix1].c_Cum_MM_Active,
durations_B = fine_cat_df[ix2].c_Cum_MM_Active,
durations_C = fine_cat_df[ix3].c_Cum_MM_Active,    
event_observed_A = fine_cat_df[ix1].y_Churn,
event_observed_B = fine_cat_df[ix2].y_Churn,
event_observed_C = fine_cat_df[ix3].y_Churn)
output.print_summary

The p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject that the null hypothesis (survival curves are identical)
